Place brand-provided small share button images in this folder.

Expected filenames (88x28 px recommended):
- rss.png
- x-share.png
- linkedin-share.png
- facebook-share.png
- hackernews-share.png
- reddit-share.png

These are referenced from `index.html` under the “Feeds and sharing” nav.
Keep file sizes tiny; PNG is fine for badges. No CSS/JS required.
