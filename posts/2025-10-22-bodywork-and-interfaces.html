        <p>When I was younger I spent time around auto body repair shops. That is where technicians fix the outside of cars: sheet metal, small dents, sanding, primer, paint, and clear coat. I mostly watched, but it changed how I see work.</p>
        <p>The simple lesson I took with me is this: polished results come from checking each layer and correcting what you find. That same approach applies to UI work.</p>

        <h2>The Layers of a Car Body</h2>
        <p>A car body is built in visible layers. There is metal for structure. There is filler to smooth imperfections. There is primer for adhesion. There is paint for color. There is clear for protection and depth.</p>
        <p>After the spray, the work is not finished. You wait for curing. You inspect under real light. You wet sand and buff until reflections look true. Only then do you know if it actually matches.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Rip and Replace vs Repair</h2>
        <p>Repair decisions often start here: replace the panel or repair the panel. Replacement is straightforward. The new part arrives with primer. You scuff, paint, and clear. It is fast and predictable.</p>
        <p>Repair is slower but often better. You find a small access point. You push from the inside with gentle pressure. You work down highs, bring up lows, add minimal filler, and sand in cycles. Bright guide lights reveal waves the eye misses.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Matching Paint Takes Judgment</h2>
        <p>Even mixing paint is not a one step task. The machine reads a code and gets close. Final matching comes from how it looks outside in the sun, not from a label. Experienced technicians adjust until the panel reads right in real conditions.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How This Maps to UI</h2>
        <p>Interfaces benefit from the same discipline. A premade component is like a new panel. It installs quickly and often fits. But the flow, copy, timing, and states still need shaping.</p>
        <p>Structured iteration gets better results. Start with structure and content. Inspect with real users and real devices. Adjust copy for clarity. Fix focus order. Improve contrast. Trim micro lags. Re test after a night of curing with fresh eyes.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>Good tools get you most of the way. The last part comes from patient, layer by layer inspection and correction. Do that, and the interface disappears until the light hits it. Then it looks right.</p>
